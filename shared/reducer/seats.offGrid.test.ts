/**
 * A mount that stands full size half a square off the grid of squares, as a
 * Large creature's walk on half squares leaves it, stands on its snapped
 * box, and its riders sit on that box's squares (RIDER-LED-HALF-SEAT, op
 * version 41). A warhorse at 1.5, 8 stands on 2, 8 to 4, 10, with Brom on
 * its left column at 2, 9. A walk by half a square to 6, 8 carried Brom by
 * the stored box to 6.5, 9, which rounds onto the right column, so the
 * prisoner he leads by his place at 4.5 squares off fell out of reach, and
 * a rider on the right column rounded off the mount's box. From 41 the
 * seats go by the snapped box, so each keeps its square, and older ops
 * replay as they were written.

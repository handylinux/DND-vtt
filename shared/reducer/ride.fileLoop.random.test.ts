/**
 * Random walks in single file aimed at one class of case (review
 * FU45B-ASTRA-06 to 08): a creature in the file whose walk ends where it
 * started, as on a loop, or that has not moved yet where a trap cuts the
 * walk, is walked like any other. Loops out of a corridor one square wide
 * and back in, followers placed on the holder's first corner so their
 * first piece has no length, carried chains (an imp carrying an owl that
 * drags a rat), creatures players cannot see, raised ground, stopping
 * traps and floor traps. For every move the server takes: every walk of a
 * creature every player sees in the file passes the leg test, on the cut
 * walk too, dispatch puts every token where the trap step's walks had it,
 * every walk of the group is in the lead's trap group, every link the
 * public pass walks holds, and every token every player sees stands where
 * the move's own stand test lets it stand (review FU45B-ASTRA-10), and
 * every link between two tokens every player sees that holds where the
 * trap step leaves them still holds (review FU45B-ASTRA-11). A second loop
 * does the same for group moves of two groups, a trap stopping one, both
 * or neither, toward a wall: a Large creature every player sees half a
 * square off its grid, dragged by a creature they may not see (review
 * FU45BR-OPUS-12), a Tiny one carried or perched in the middle of a chain,
 * and a goblin riding a Large horse, each holder hidden on most seeds.
 * Each case with a creature players cannot see is also played in two
 * fogged rooms, the second with short walls no player sees near the hidden
 * walks, and every player's copy and the undo mark must match
 * (`pairedTwin`, review FU45B-ASTRA-12).
